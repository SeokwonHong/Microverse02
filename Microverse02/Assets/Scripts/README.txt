To do:


1. if core cell too far = pull, 
too close = push




For emergence:

	Self-organizing (morphogenesis)
		


	Self-regulating (homeostasis) 



	Self-directing (motility)

		Directing based on Lennard-Jones potential?
	

	Self-replicating (reproduction)

		If organism becomes too massive, reproduce himself?


	Entropy reduction (metabolism)

		organism eats dead cells?
		Otherwise Death?


	Growth (development)

		Everytime Organism eats dead cells, it gets bigger? cellDistance bigger, generate one more shell cell?


	Response to stimuli (sensitivity)



	Response to environment (adaptability)



	Evolving through mutation and selection (evolvability)

	Procedual Design? 
	1. Hover the mouse
	2. Click
	3. Space


	Variation? 

	small organism -> eat -> bigger -> split

	Bacteria is like a Snake


	player is like a demon from mononoke hime
