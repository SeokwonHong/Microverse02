To do:


1. if core cell too far = pull, 
too close = push




For emergence:

	Self-organizing (morphogenesis)
		


	Self-regulating (homeostasis) 



	Self-directing (motility)

		Directing based on Lennard-Jones potential?

	Self-replicating (reproduction)

		If organism becomes too massive, reproduce himself?

	Entropy reduction (metabolism)

		organism eats dead cells?
		Otherwise Death?

	Growth (development)

		Everytime Organism eats dead cells, it gets bigger? cellDistance bigger, generate one more shell cell?


	Response to stimuli (sensitivity)



	Response to environment (adaptability)



	Evolving through mutation and selection (evolvability)
